# o-factor

The o-factor (open science factor)

This is a project started in Neurohackademy in August 2018.
The goal is to give journals (and leter on also papers / scientists and more) a score of how "open science" they are.
We want to find a way to promote open science and give incentives for scientists and journals to do and support more open science.

What does this project include?
* Scraper (we are planning to start with a simple API to get preliminary data, and then try to add more data from other APIs.
* A formula to calculate the o-factor (and possibly related topics which we are not sure of)
* A web-app


Contributers (ABC order):
* Daniel Reznik
* Emily Wood
* Federico Adolfi
* Kristina Rapuano
* Mikella Green
* Rosa Li
* Rotem Botvinik-Nezer
* Scott Cole
